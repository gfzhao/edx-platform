    Counters for 'attempted', 'succeeded', 'failed', 'skipped' keys are initialized to zero,
    as is the 'duration_ms' value.  A 'start_time' is stored for later duration calculations,
    and the total number of "things to do" is set, so the user can be told how much needs to be
    done overall.  The `action_name` is also stored, to help with constructing more readable

    information for each subtask.  The value for each subtask (keyed by its task_id)

    This information needs to be set up in the InstructorTask before any of the subtasks start
    running.  If not, there is a chance that the subtasks could complete before the parent task
    is done creating subtasks.  Doing so also simplifies the save() here, as it avoids the need
    for locking.

    rely on the status stored in the InstructorTask object, rather than status stored in the

    Accumulates values for 'attempted', 'succeeded', 'failed', 'skipped' from `new_subtask_status`

    original task, so is subject to clock skew.

    information for each subtask.  At the moment, the value for each subtask (keyed by its task_id)
